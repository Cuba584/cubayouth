It is transculturation that produced Son, the fusion of percussion created by African slaves with the stringed instruments introduced by the Spanish. Cuban music, Faya says, is reliant on the incorporation and adaptation of other sounds to continue evolving."

Hip-hop gained traction in Cuba during the Special Period, when the Soviet Union — a nation Cuba heavily relied on — collapsed, leaving Cuba in extreme economic strife. It was during this period, the 1990s, that young Cubans began to rap about their grievances with the government."

Being a part of agency isn’t mandatory — it’s competitive, and though they are in it now, Reyna and Yadira didn’t make it when they first auditioned — but attempting to be a successful rapper without the press and benefits the agency secures isn’t ideal."

Rap is about moving forward boldly, not looking at the past to diagnose the present but working hard to ensure a fulfilling future."

Yes, they’re still cooking rice for dinner — maybe in arroz con pollo or arroz a la cubana, the traditional Cuban dishes they grew up eating. But these days, it’s okay to let it burn. It tastes better that way."
