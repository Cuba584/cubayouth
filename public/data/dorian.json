Dorian’s right eyebrow — coincidentally dyed the same bright hue —highlights his deep set, coffee brown eyes, which carefully ponder his next course of action. His eyebrows furrow and flicker in his eye is just visible before, in an instant, the scissors close, tresses fall to the floor- and electricity surges through the room. Dorian is shaping his next masterpiece."

Clean shaven and tanned from the Havana sun, Damian Carbonell studies the screen of his phone instead of his brother’s chromatic creations. He leans over, boasting about the salon’s updated website accessible through Wi-Fi in the salon, a rare arrangement in Cuba where internet access usually requires a pre-paid government card that can only be used in certain hot spots."

Dorian is the artist; Damian is the administrator. Together they entered into a family business which they said aims to reshape the idea of masculine style and beauty in Cuba. Dorian has a reputation for using his hairstyling expertise to help the images of Cuba’s top recording artists come alive, and, as a result, Havana’s youth flock to his salon so that they, too, can rock a Donde Dorian original ‘do. But before Dorian could transform the looks of his clients, he said he needed to undergo a transformation of his own."

      "value": "A self-proclaimed club rat, Dorian said he was very much like any typical Cuban guy in his 20s enjoying the party scene. In the 1990s, Cuba dealt with shortages after the country lost its main trade partner with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Dorian lived his life in ignorant bliss as a young model who secretly attended barber school classes at night as a hobby. His most prized possession, his German 1980’s model MZ motorcycle that he rode through the streets of Havana’s hottest Vedado neighborhood."

      "type": "text",
      "value": "Dorian and Damian founded a private business out of their parents’ home in 2009. Two years later, the Cuban government enacted a new policy called Los Lineamientos para la Política Económica y Social that lists 300 guidelines for allowing small and medium-sized businesses in Cuba to be privately operated. As a result, some state-owned barber shops were allowed to be privately run by staff, giving them more agency to make managerial decisions. Dorian and Damian were granted a license to operate Salon Donde Dorian out of their private residence, but, now that their business is trying to expand, they face new challenges in a country that still very much limits entrepreneurship and internet access. As the Cuban government loosens its hold, allowing its citizens to go into business for themselves, pursuing a Cuban Dream still proves difficult within a nation that limits opportunity and prides itself on the equal distribution of wealth."
