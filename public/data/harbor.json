Orlando Ochoa Méndez is exhausted, hunched over friends in the middle of the dance floor, but his tired brown eyes flicker to life when he realizes how late it is. He says frantic goodbyes, quick kisses on both cheeks flying through the air as he bolts out of Fábrica de Arte Cubano, a warehouse now transformed into one of Havana’s most well-known nightclubs. He scans the street for a taxi, his dark skin no longer livened by blankets of blue and green light from inside the club — everything feels dim now that he’s competing with the clock. Orlando chooses a classic Cuban ride, a baby blue Chevy born in 1956, somehow finding the driver who’s an old friend — or maybe they’re meeting for the first time, with Orlando you’re never quite sure.  “Llevame a la lanchita de Regla,” he tells the driver."

While still technically a part of the greater Havana area, Regla feels far more removed than a five-minute ferry ride. The star that pinpoints Havana as the country’s capital on any given map of Cuba stamps right over the harbor that divides these two areas. But these regions cannot be so simply merged — the star extinguishes Regla’s individuality, its smokestacks that hint at its industrial past, its streets blemished with missing chunks of cement and its homes that are stained in soot. There’s less urgency on this side of the harbor; in Regla, time is a suggestion of sorts. Orlando knows that while the final ferry home is always scheduled to leave Havana’s port at 12:15 a.m., any set-in-stone schedule is subjective, as the ferry driver often decides to leave at whatever time will get him home fastest, even if it’s the wrong one."

Orlando has spent the last 15 hours on his feet, working in the heart of Havana as a tour coordinator, carting visitors — recently, more Americans — around his island country. Enduring endless Hola’s with a little too much H, hailing convertible cabs so visitors can fully feel that Cuban breeze, reserving restaurants, reserving new restaurants when visitors decide they actually wanted something different — this is an hour of Orlando’s day at work. But on the other side of the harbor, it’s different. And when Orlando says goodnight to Havana every evening as he retreats into Regla, he says goodnight to a part of himself he won’t see again until morning."

Maybe it’s the collared shirts — he buys all his clothes in America, he says — or his enigmatic energy that feels out of place in Regla’s sleepy streets, or the fact that, unlike some of his Reglan neighbors, Orlando could afford to take a taxi around the harbor back home if he were to miss the boat. “I have a feeling that people know who I am in my neighborhood, and that’s kind of weird,” he says. “But I don’t always know their name.”"

These jobs are changing families, introducing new household dynamics as children are making more money than their parents ever thought plausible. It’s forcing this generation of young workers to reconcile the hardships of their youth — the Special Period of economic collapse in Cuba during the 1990s, when Gross Domestic Product dropped by 34 percent — with a now-tangible notion of hope that lives in Havana. Beyond lessened airfare prices, old cars, rum and cigars, beyond the ways travel will impact the Cuban economy, this growing tourism industry is changing the lives of the Cubans that run it, the ones that live just across the harbor."

Tourism from visitors all over the world has been on the rise, too — over two million travelers visited Cuba during the first half of 2016, an 11.7 percent increase from 2015, according to the National Office of Statistics and Information."

These reasons include family visits, journalistic activity, educational activities and humanitarian projects, but according to the treasury department, a traveler is not allowed to visit Cuba for the pure purpose of tourism."

The United States? The questions come mostly from older people, ones who feel worlds apart from the Facebook fanatics now flocking to their country. They’re happy asking Orlando their questions, and he’s happy to be their window to the rest of the world."
